Well, at least approximately, it was one year ago that my then-fiance Jen and I started doing dog sitting with [Rover](https://www.rover.com/members/robert-a-scientist-fellow-dog-dad-married/) as an extracurricular activity. 

Why did we jump in? First and most importantly, because we absolutely love dogs! I've always dreamed of someday leading a pack of dogs. However, for many reasons, this isn't really a good idea, and so I wanted to do the next best thing, and instead help take care of dogs when their parents travel. 

The experience has been a blessing, as Jen, myself, and our two pups, Chester and Maddie, have gotten to meet so many great dogs, each wonderful in their own unique way. We've learned so much about our dogs and dogs in general, that its been an invaluable experience, and for anyone with the dedication, it really is a deeply enriching experience. 

One of the best parts about Rover is the photo updates - naturally, over the course of many sittings I've accumulated numerous awesome photos of all our visitors. I wanted to take a moment to share some of my personal favorites from our visitors, plus some extras from our own travels - enjoy!
